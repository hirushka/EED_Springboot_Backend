Development of Web-Based Nuclear or Radiological Emergency Exercise Simulation System (EESS)

#Background
According to IAEA, nuclear and radiological emergency exercises and trainings should frequently conduct to assess the ability to respond successfully to real-world nuclear or radiological emergencies. (IAEA, 2005). 
Considering all the experience from past nuclear or radiological emergencies, International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) has published Safety Standards for Preparedness and Response to Nuclear or Radiological Emergency General Safety Requirements GSR Part 7 and other relevant IAEA safety standards.


#Problem

Ionization radiation sources are widely used in Sri Lanka for industrial and medical purposes.

Although, authorities have taken measures to ensure the  safety of public and environment, there is a probability of occurring a nuclear or radiological emergency.

There are procedures and guild lines that need to be followed during such an emergency, but they are in a real-life situation, following the procedures while looking the printed media is difficult and every personnel who may involve in the emergency responses should train very well, where they can play the central role.

In Sri Lanka, participants in emergency exercises analyze and discuss issues based more on paper-based media information than on computer-based system.

#Question
How to satisfy the requirement of the person who is facing a nuclear or radiological emergency by using those authorized procedures and guidelines? , how can make every emergency response personnel be aware of the exact procedures to follow during such an emergency?

#Solution
Develop a system with distributed approach computerizing the manual procedures into a digital-based system and addressing all the main functionalities to overcome the current issue.

#Objectives
To develop a web-based system to conduct emergency exercises as an aid for preparing in nuclear or radiological emergency in Sri Lanka.

To enhance the knowledge on standard operational procedures among the emergency workers and stakeholders.

To serve as an easy platform for calculating the activity of a source and safety distance to be maintained based on that during a situation.

To provide details about the possible nuclear or radiological emergencies based on the emergency level, threat categories and location.

#What is Emergency Exercise Simulation System(EESS)?
EESS is a web-based system that enables the simulation of emergency exercises and provides information relevant to nuclear or radiological emergencies.
